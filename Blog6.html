                    <p >As you all know, Corona Virus is a virus that is mainly transmitted through droplets of saliva when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or even exhales. These droplets fall on floors or surfaces of even clothes because they are heavy, the virus in the droplets can survive on those surfaces for hours; and that is why people are always advised to wash their hands regularly.<p>
                    <p >Many people have lost their lives because of this virus and many people have lost friends, family members, and partners because of this virus; but there has also been many recoveries as well, even though the number of deaths surpasses the number of recoveries. A lockdown has been implemented in order to try and control and stop the spread the of this virus, and not just in South Africa but in the entire world; some have argued that the lockdown is a violation to human rights but I feel the lockdown was a necessary step the government needed to take in order to flatten the curve. Most businesses are not operating, schools are closed and people are not allowed to walk around in the streets, people are not allowed to travel; and because of this many businesses are losing profit, and life is just a mess.<p>
                    <p >The government deployed the military all over the country so that they could help combat this pandemic, however, we have seen reports of the military abusing their power; we have seen pictures and videos of them abusing civilians, even the civilians that went outside to buy essential products. The actions of the military have made people question their ethics as well as their morals; the implication here is that the military were chosen because they are supposed to be ethical people and are expected to act ethically. They were expected to protect the civilians and to make sure that people stay in their homes, unless they are in need of buying food or toiletries; but instead they have been making people do squats and making them roll around in the dirt while they take videos and share those videos on social media.<p>
                    <p >When it comes to education, this pandemic has in my opinion revealed a divide in our country. Since the whole country is on lockdown, some institutions decided to move towards the direction of online learning; and this shift highlighted the issues that we still face today as a country, one of which being the digital divide. Digital divide basically refers to the gap between the rich and poor in terms of computer use, it is the gap between those who have access to the internet and those who do not. It can also mean the divide between those who are computer literate and those who do not even have the basic knowledge of how a computer works, or a smartphone, or any other digital gadgets.<p>
                    <p >I know from personal experience that when I started varsity I did not know how to perform a lot of digital tasks; the only computer literacy class that was offered at my high school only taught learners the very basic skills, skills such as how to turn on or shutdown your computer, how to create folders, how to copy and paste. This subject/programme was offered from grade 10-12, learners had a choice between that subject and geography, I chose geography. When I arrived in university, I realised that I was actually computer illiterate compared to my peers who had computers their entire lives, some of them even had knowledge of coding already.</p>
                    <p >Some institutions have tried to bridge the digital divide, institutions such as the University of The Witwatersrand for example. Wits has loaned students laptops, they have given their students 30GB data because they understand that not all students have access to uncapped Wi-Fi or can even afford data; they also sent emails to their students educating them on how the sites work and how to access certain sites. Wits is really making an effort to make sure that students are not going to be forced to miss out on an academic year, however, this system is really new and it might take time before everyone can adjust to it, more especially the people that are not used to using computers. <p>
                    <p >In terms of the technologies or software that can be used for online learning, the new and improved wits sakai( e-learning website for wits students) works well. The method of having pre-recorded lecture videos works well, because students are able to pause, rewind as many times as they want to; and the concept of forums on sakai also work really well. For consultations I would recommend an app called Zoom, for those that need one on one consultations because they are too anxious about talking on Microsoft Teams while everyone listens.<p>
                    <p > pandemic has caused many people to come up with a lot of conspiracy theories on why all of this is happening and what caused the corona virus in the first place, and I have one of my own. I feel like this is all happening in preparation for the fourth industrial revolution; I feel like we are being forced to adapt to using technology because in the fourth industrial revolution everything will be digitized, the lines between the physical, digital and biological world will be blurry. <p>

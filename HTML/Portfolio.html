            <h2> MORE ABOUT ME <h2>

               <p> As I have already mentioned, my name is Naledi and I am 23 years old. I work as a Video Production assistant, it’s not what I have always wanted to do in life but hey, here we are. I am originally from a small town called Potchefstroom, I was born and raised there. My life back in Potchefstroom has always been simple; I had a small circle of friends, online. My mom thought I just didn’t like people but actually I do, sometimes. I came to Johannesburg because of school, I had been accepted for a film and television programme and the University of Johannesburg. The reason why I chose to do film and tv was because I wanted to try something different, something that did not involve physics or mathematics. 
                I am still not certain about what I really want to do professionally, but I know that I just want to learn any and every skill. At some point in my life I wanted to be a pilot, but then I got introduced to grade 10 maths and that dream just died. I also wanted to be a fashion designer, fashion buyer, a tv personality, a graphic designer, a fine artist, a software developer, and an animator.
                I feel like currently, I am on a journey, a journey to figure out who Naledi is as a person and journey to find real happiness, if that even exists in real life.</p>

            <h2> MY INSPIRATION <h2>

                <p>I grew up in a lovely little township called Ikageng, and I remember my childhood to be a very happy one. I lived with my grandmother, my uncles and my mom; my grandmother was an arts teacher at a primary school I attended. I loved spending time with my grandmother, she is late now, but she will forever be the most talented person I know; there wasn’t anything she didn’t know how to do. She knew how to draw, how to paint, she was a seamstress, she also knew how to knit. She would knit dresses for dolls, make jewellery out of recyclable materials, she even made caps from cans; and she would sell all of those at a festival called Aardlkop.
                Our house is opposite a tarven, and back then there used to be an event called Jazz Sundays. Once a month, people would come with their camping chairs and sit on the lawns and listen to jazz music while drinking; and on those days my grandmother would make plates of food to sell, those were my favourite days.  I think that in life, I aspire to be something like how my grandmother was. She was the most happiest most talented and most loved person I knew, I think her mission in life was to also acquire as many skills as she could, and she did; and if she were still alive, I know for a fact that she would have acquired more!</p>

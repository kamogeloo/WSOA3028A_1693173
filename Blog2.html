        <p style="color: white;font-size: x-large;">The URL, according to the MDN website, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, it is  an address of a given unique resource on the Web. The URL is a tool used by browsers to extract any published resource on the web. Browsers are programs that retrieve and display pages from the web, and let users access further pages through hyperlinks; hyperlinks connect webpages or data items to one another. The URL is composed of different parts, some parts of it are important and some are optional. </p>

        <p style="color: white;font-size: x-large;">The first part of the URL shows which protocol the browser must use, e.g. http/https; a protocol is a method for exchanging or transferring data around a computer network. The second part is the domain name, this part of the URL indicates which server is being requested ; an example of this is www.example.com. Next, is the port; the port indicates the technical “gate” used to access the resources on the web server. Path to the file, is the next part; this is the path to the resource on the Web server, an example of that is /path/to/myfile.html. After the port is the parameters, parameters are a list of key pairs separated with the & symbol; these are often used by the web server to do extra stuff before returning the resource, an example of this is ?key=value1&key2=value2. What comes after the parameters is the anchor; an anchor represents a kind of “bookmark” inside the resource, which gives the browser the directions to show the content located at that “bookmarked” spot. On an TML document, the browser will scroll to the defined anchor, it will try to the time the anchor represents, an example of an anchor on the URL is #SomewhereInTheDocument, the # is known as the fragment identifier and it is never sent to the server with the request. </p>

        <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);font-size: x-large;">When it comes to URLs, it is always advised that developers use semantic URLs; and this is because they use words with that can be understood by anyone, regardless of their technical literacy. Semantic URLs are also easier to manipulate, and they clarify things for users in terms of where they are, what they are doing, what they are reading or interacting with on the web. </p>

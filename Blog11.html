    <p> The fourth industrial revolution describes an age when the boundaries between the physical, digital, and biological worlds become blurred, it combines the three together. When President Cyril Ramaphosa proposed the idea of implementing the fourth industrial revolution into his national economic strategy, he received a lot of criticism because it does promote neoliberalism.</p>
    
    <p>Neoliberalism is the concept that the nature of democracy is about generating capital, and it tends to get rid of the ideas of the public, the only ideas that are taken and heard are those of the ones in power. </p>

    <p> I personally do not agree with the idea of implementing the fourth industrial revolution in South Africa YET, we are definitely not yet ready for that implementation. The reason why is because the unemployment rate in South Africa is already high right now with work that require very basic skills, now imagine the unemployment rate with work that will require digital skills, it is too risky.</p>
    
    <p>Another reason is because in terms of the fact that there is a digital divide still, all levels of digital divide. There are still people who do not have access to certain technological devices, most people do not have the digital skills that could benefit them financially or in any other way. There is so much inequality that the bridge between the rich and the poor is going to get bigger rather than smaller. </p>
    
    <p>With the machines doing everything there certainly will be a lot of people that will lose employment, because they will be replaced with machines. Therefore, while the fourth industrial revolution may “grow” the economy, it will just make the rich richer and the poor poorer. </p>

    <p> I do, however, agree with critics that say that we should prepare for it first before implementing it. People should get training first so that they are better prepared for the revolution, that will better bridge some gaps, not completely, but that is much better than increasing inequalities. </p>

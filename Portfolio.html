            <h2> MORE ABOUT ME </h2>
               <p> As I have already mentioned, my name is Naledi and I am 23 years old. I work as a Video Production assistant, it’s not what I have always wanted to do in life but hey, here we are. I am originally from a small town called Potchefstroom, I was born and raised there. My life back in Potchefstroom has always been simple; I had a small circle of friends, online.</p>
               <p> My mom thought I just didn’t like people but actually I do, sometimes. I came to Johannesburg because of school, I had been accepted for a film and television programme and the University of Johannesburg. The reason why I chose to do film and tv was because I wanted to try something different, something that did not involve physics or mathematics.</p>
                <p>I am still not certain about what I really want to do professionally, but I know that I just want to learn any and every skill. At some point in my life I wanted to be a pilot, but then I got introduced to grade 10 maths and that dream just died. I also wanted to be a fashion designer, fashion buyer, a tv personality, a graphic designer, a fine artist, a software developer, and an animator.</p>
                <p>I feel like currently, I am on a journey, a journey to figure out who Naledi is as a person and journey to find real happiness, if that even exists in real life.</p>

            <h2>MY INSPIRATION</h2>

                <p>I grew up in a lovely little township called Ikageng, and I remember my childhood to be a very happy one. I lived with my grandmother, my uncles and my mom; my grandmother was an arts teacher at a primary school I attended.</p>
                <p>I loved spending time with my grandmother, she is late now, but she will forever be the most talented person I know; there wasn’t anything she didn’t know how to do. She knew how to draw, how to paint, she was a seamstress, she also knew how to knit.</p> She would knit dresses for dolls, make jewellery out of recyclable materials, she even made caps from cans; and she would sell all of those at a festival called Aardlkop.
                Our house is opposite a tarven, and back then there used to be an event called Jazz Sundays. Once a month, people would come with their camping chairs and sit on the lawns and listen to jazz music while drinking; and on those days my grandmother would make plates of food to sell, those were my favourite days.  I think that in life, I aspire to be something like how my grandmother was. She was the most happiest most talented and most loved person I knew, I think her mission in life was to also acquire as many skills as she could, and she did; and if she were still alive, I know for a fact that she would have acquired more!</p>

                <h2>HAIR</h2>
                <p>Growing up, hair used to be a really big thing for me; I wanted to have long hair, I wanted to have long straight hair and I’ll tell you why. I was a very observant child, I noticed everything that occurred in my environment, I noticed that certain people get treated differently because of how they look. I noticed that the girls with the light skin complexion and the long straight hair were the most liked, not just by the kids at school but also by the teachers. </p>
                <p>Everyone wanted to be friends with those girls, those were the Regina George of my primary and high school days; and I remember at some point I also wanted to be liked, but I didn’t have light skin, I could, however, grow my hair out. I did grow my hair, but because I was using relaxers and a lot of heat on my hair, my hair would not grow past my neck; but I was happy that my hair was at least long enough to put up into a ponytail, and in the township(or at least where I’m from), if your hair can do that, you have long hair.</p>
                <p>I remember me and two cousins would visit the hair salon once a month to either relax or wash our hair; and I would leave the salon heartbroken every time, because my hair would not be as straight and flat as my cousins’ hair. Now, I realise that my hair fighting back, it would not allow itself to get completely fried or to die.</p>
                <p>My hair did finally get as straight and flat and I had always wanted, that was in the last year of high school; and while I did get praises for it looking “good”, I was not happy. It made my head look too small and I felt really bald.</p>
                <p>I began transitioning from relaxed to natural hair in my first year of college, and I have been learning so much about my hair and how I can protect it and keep it healthy; I have also had to unlearn a lot of things regarding hair. For me, my hair is more than just about beauty, it symbolises my personal growth. This is not to say that long hair means that I have grown more; it just means that I now know that “good hair” is not just relaxed long hair.</p>

             <p>I like to call Braam my other home; this is where my life began really, it’s where I found myself (well, some parts of myself) and where most of my friendships began. 
                 I came to live in Braam in 2016, I lived in different South Point buildings and took the bus everyday to and from campus. My experience living in Braam has been nothing but amazing, the weekends were the best times because they were the fun times.
                There is always something happening there, there is so much to do; most creatives come to Braam during the weekends, so there are so many opportunities to network and form friendships and business relationships too. </p>
                <p>Even the aesthtics in Braam scream art, you see </p>

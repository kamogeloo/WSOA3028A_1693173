        <p id="content">In this article I will be discussing the interesting points that I picked up from the three readings that I read this week. The first reading that I will be discussing is an essay titled “As We May Think” written by Vannevar Bush in the year 1945. The second will be a short story titled “The Library of Babel”, which was written by Jorge Luis Borges in the year 1998, Bush wrote about his beliefs and his hopes for the advancement of technological devices in the future. Bush believed that machines and technological/digital innovations could be made and improved with great economic effort; this gives off the impression that Bush believed that capitalism was the driver of innovation. He used the example of Liebniz, who invented a calculating machine called the Step Reckoner; Liebniz’s calculating machine was not and could not developed for commercial production, and Bush believed that this was because the “economics of the situation” were against Liebniz and his invention(); he argued that the labour involved in constructing the machine “exceeded the labour to be saved by its use”(Bush V, 1979, pg37) , calculating using a piece of paper and a pen seemed easier.</p>

        <p id="content">The URL, according to the MDN website, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, it is  an address of a given unique resource on the Web. The URL is a tool used by browsers to extract any published resource on the web. Browsers are programs that retrieve and display pages from the web, and let users access further pages through hyperlinks; hyperlinks connect webpages or data items to one another. The URL is composed of different parts, some parts of it are important and some are optional.The first part of the URL shows which protocol the browser must use, e.g. http/https; a protocol is a method for exchanging or transferring data around a computer network. The second part is the domain name, this part of the URL indicates which server is being requested ; an example of this is www.example.com. Next, is the port; the port indicates the technical “gate” used to access the resources on the web server. Path to the file, is the next part; this is the path to the resource on the Web server, an example of that is /path/to/myfile.html. After the port is the parameters, parameters are a list of key pairs separated with the & symbol; these are often used by the web server to do extra stuff before returning the resource, an example of this is ?key=value1&key2=value2. What comes after the parameters is the anchor; an anchor represents a kind of “bookmark” inside the resource, which gives the browser the directions to show the content located at</p>

        <p id="content"> In this article I will be looking at web robots; I will be discussing what they are, what they do and what they are used for. Web robots according to Ratan(2017) are software applications that travel across any web applications and perform a variety of automated tasks; I was at first confused when I first read this definition of what a web robot is, because I have always assumed that ‘robots’ were machines that one can physically see and maybe even touch. Web robots are again referred to as web spiders or web crawlers, and what they do is, they  take information from different web servers, analyse that information and then file it at a speed that is much faster than that of humans, if they were to perform the exact same task.  </p>

        <p id="content">The meaning of hypertext is one that was very difficult to define, many researchers and scholars  have tried to define it, however it seems as though overtime someone comes up with a definition, there are always people waiting to disagree with them there is always fault with someone’s definition and as a result. People came up with their own definition anyway of what a hypertext is. Marie-LaureRyan[5] stated that in “in hypertext, the reader determines the unfolding of the text clicking on hyperlinks that bring to the screen other segments of a text”. Espen Aarseth[1] argued that hypertext is merely a direct link from one position in a text to another;  well known known researchers argued against this definition because they believed that link-based understandings missed “the profound aspects of hypertext” especially “hypertext-as-interaction with information to build associations, and through associations build knowledge”. </p>

        <p id="content">User Experience design is a process of design that is centred around the psychology of the end-user, the end-user is the person who would be interacting with your site or game or whatever product you design. This process looks at how the end-user behaves, how they think and their capabilities, and couples it with data collection, an interactive design process, and testing(playtesting, in the context of games). The reason why it is important for designers to use this process is not only for them to just understand the user but it is to also make sure that they create products that will be easy to use, products that will assist users to accomplish certain goals and create meaningful experiences for the users.<p>

These droplets fall on floors or surfaces of even clothes because they are heavy, the virus in the droplets can survive on those surfaces for hours; and that is why people are always advised to wash their hands regularly.<p>

Something can also be considered interactive when it requires nontrivial effort, and if it can modify the shape of the text in some way. Hypertext is the organization of information units into connected associations that a user can choose to make,  provide the most common form of interactivity when using the Web.</p>

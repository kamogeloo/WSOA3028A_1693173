<p1 style="color:white;font-size:large ">The meaning of hypertext is one that was very difficult to define, many researchers and scholars  have tried to define it, however it seems as though overtime someone comes up with a definition, there are always people waiting to disagree with them there is always fault with someone’s definition and as a result. People came up with their own definition anyway of what a hypertext is. Marie-LaureRyan[5] stated that in “in hypertext, the reader determines the unfolding of the text clicking on hyperlinks that bring to the screen other segments of a text”. Espen Aarseth[1] argued that hypertext is merely a direct link from one position in a text to another;  well known known researchers argued against this definition because they believed that link-based understandings missed “the profound aspects of hypertext” especially “hypertext-as-interaction with information to build associations, and through associations build knowledge”.</p1>

<p1 style="color:white;font-size:large ">The term “hypertext” was invented by a man named Theodor Holm Nelson; Nelson first defined hypertext as being “a body of written or pictorial interconnected in such a complex way that it could not be presented on represented on paper”; Nelson also invented the term hypermedia to refer to the images, the graphics, sounds etc that could be interlinked Hypertext was central to the creation of World Wide Web.</p1>

<p1 style="color:white;font-size:large ">Hypertext covers textual hyperlinks and graphical ones; and through the use of textual link, web pages  written in Hypertext Mark-up Language(HTML). Without hypertext, clicking and following a link on a topic to a related article on that topic would be impossible.</p1>

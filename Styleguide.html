              <p >I am not yet certain which colour palette I will be using in my final iteration of the website, and that is why I am still playing around with different background colours on my pages. I do, however, like the background colour that  I used on my Homepage; so for now i will for the color palette below.</p>

                <p> Ideally, I would like my website to be as interactive as the one on the gif above. It looks minimalistic but also very artistic, it looks like it as a perfect balance. It is also very interactive, it has a lot of animations, and it has great feedback. </p>

                   <p>The look that I am trying to achieve with my website is a very simple, minimalistic but also artistic aesthetic. My character, Naledi is very simple but also very artistic.</p> 

                 <p> I tried to show Naledi's artistic side by adding gifs and interesting artsy images for the blogs while keeping the site very minimal.  </p>

         <div class = "aboutsection">
            <h2 >Colour palette<h2>

              <p>After playing around with different coloured backgrounds on my previous iterations, i have decided to stick with a simple gray background, to keep the site looking nice and neat.</p>

                <p> Ideally, I would've like my website to be as interactive as the one on the gif above. It looks minimalistic but also very artistic, it looks like it as a perfect balance. It is also very interactive, it has a lot of animations, and it has great feedback. </p>
                 <p> This is a prototype still and therefore my site will eventualy get to be more interactive and more aesthetically pleasing, in my other iterations.</p>

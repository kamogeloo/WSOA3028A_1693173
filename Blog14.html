    <p> A framework is a platform for developing software applications, it is according to Wikipedia an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific code. </p>
    
    <p> Frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and application programming interfaces (API).  Application programming interfaces is an interface that has a set of functions that allow programmers to access specific data of an application, operating system or other services, and this interface can be accessed using HTTP protocol. Web APIs are a way of exposing code functionality of a code without exposing the code itself and they can be built using technology such as .NET, JavaScript, Java etc.  </p>

    <p> The DOM is an API that allows programmers to access and modify the document.
        The Web API that I chose to use in my portfolio section is the fetch API, it is a JavaScript API (JSON). The fetch () is a communication API that allows programmers to create a better API for simple things, using modern JavaScript features like promises which enables a simpler API a. It allows programmers to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest. APIs in general are important to have because the allow the sharing of capabilities between computer programs and they are very important for businesses.
        </p>
    
    <p>  According to the MDN website the fetch API It provides a JavaScript interface for getting access to and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, such as requests and responses and provides the global fetch method that gives programmers an easy, logical means of fetching resources asynchronously across the network. The alternatives for the fetch API include jQuery, vanilla JS.</p>
    
    <p>I chose the fetch API because the promise returned from fetch does not reject on HTTP error status, it will resolve, and it will only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the request from completing (MDN). It will not receive cross-site cookies, which are a type of browser exploit which allows a site attacker or web robots to set a cookie for a browser into the cookie domain another browser; and it will also not send any cookies. This means is to avoid visitors from getting that annoying message about cookies every time they visit a site and also avoid trackers or possible armful web robots (their information will be kept private). I also chose it because it is compatible with most browsers.  </p>

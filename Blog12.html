    <content id= "Posts">
    <p>In this article I will be discussing the interesting points that I picked up from the three readings that I read this week. The first reading that I will be discussing is an essay titled “As We May Think” written by Vannevar Bush in the year 1945. The second will be a short story titled “The Library of Babel”, which was written by Jorge Luis Borges in the year 1998, Bush wrote about his beliefs and his hopes for the advancement of technological devices in the future. Bush believed that machines and technological/digital innovations could be made and improved with great economic effort; this gives off the impression that Bush believed that capitalism was the driver of innovation. He used the example of Liebniz, who invented a calculating machine called the Step Reckoner; Liebniz’s calculating machine was not and could not developed for commercial production, and Bush believed that this was because the “economics of the situation” were against Liebniz and his invention; he argued that the labour involved in constructing the machine “exceeded the labour to be saved by its use”(Bush V, 1979, pg37) , calculating using a piece of paper and a pen seemed easier. </p>
    
    <p >Bush in this essay also talks about how he hoped the functionality of certain machines could be improved in the future. He talk about photography and how he hoped there would be dry photography in the future and also that the process of making the photographs would take less time. What Bush hoped for, with regards to photography is now a reality; we have instant dry and even digital photography.   </p>

    <p >Bush introduced the ideology of the memex during the 1930s, he imagined the memex to be a type of memory augmentation involving a micro-based “device in which an individual stores all their books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory”(Bush V, 1945). Bush wanted the memex to work like the brain, only with an extended memory. He wanted the memex to link data by association rather than by indexes and traditional, hierarchical storage paradigms, and can be easily accessed as a “future device for individual use, a sort of mechanized private file and library” in the shape of a desk(Bush V, 1945).  </p>
    
    <p >The idea of the memex and the library of babel are very close to the internet today. The library of Babel is referred to by Borge as the universe, one that is filled with hexagons, words, pages, and books( Borges J, 1998). In the library of Babel, every page has different on it and the information on each and every page has been predetermined. You can find every single word, , sentence, or phrase that has ever been written or said in the English language. I found this hard to believe, so I went to The Library of Babel and I searched “Kamogelo is Queen”, and I found it on page 290 of volume 24 which is on the 3rd shelf on the 3rd wall of the library. The reason why I believe that the library of Babel and the memex are closely related to the internet is because the internet is a collection knowledge and people can search and access information on it. </p>
    
    <p >Another thing that I found interesting in the readings is that in the Bush’s essay, he talks about a machine called Voder, and how a girl would stroke its keys and it would emit recognisable speech. Here he talks about a woman coding, this stood out to me because I have always programmers and developers being represented as only males on the media. Having learnt this information I went online and googled “female programmers”, and found an article titled “The Secret History of Women in Coding”. This article was written by Clive Thompson and he talks about a woman named Lady A Lovelace; who, in 1833 wrote the first computer program in History(Thompson, 2019). This new piece of information makes me want to now be a programmer!. </p>

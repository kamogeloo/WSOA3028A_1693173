            <p>In this article I will be discussing the interesting points that I picked up from the three readings that I read this week. The first reading that I will be discussing is an essay titled “As We May Think” written by Vannevar Bush in the year 1945. The second will be a short story titled “The Library of Babel”, which was written by Jorge Luis Borges in the year 1998, Bush wrote about his beliefs and his hopes for the advancement of technological devices in the future. Bush believed that machines and technological/digital innovations could be made and improved with great economic effort; this gives off the impression that Bush believed that capitalism was the driver of innovation. He used the example of Liebniz, who invented a calculating machine called the Step Reckoner; Liebniz’s calculating machine was not and could not developed for commercial production, and Bush believed that this was because the “economics of the situation” were against Liebniz and his invention(); he argued that the labour involved in constructing the machine “exceeded the labour to be saved by its use”(Bush V, 1979, pg37) , calculating using a piece of paper and a pen seemed easier.</p>

            <p>The URL, according to the MDN website, stands for Uniform Resource Locator, it is  an address of a given unique resource on the Web. The URL is a tool used by browsers to extract any published resource on the web. Browsers are programs that retrieve and display pages from the web, and let users access further pages through hyperlinks; hyperlinks connect webpages or data items to one another. The URL is composed of different parts, some parts of it are important and some are optional.</p>

            <p> In this article I will be looking at web robots; I will be discussing what they are, what they do and what they are used for. Web robots according to Ratan(2017) are software applications that travel across any web applications and perform a variety of automated tasks; I was at first confused when I first read this definition of what a web robot is, because I have always assumed that ‘robots’ were machines that one can physically see and maybe even touch. Web robots are again referred to as web spiders or web crawlers, and what they do is, they  take information from different web servers, analyse that information and then file it at a speed that is much faster than that of humans, if they were to perform the exact same task.  </p>

            <p>The meaning of hypertext is one that was very difficult to define, many researchers and scholars  have tried to define it, however it seems as though overtime someone comes up with a definition, there are always people waiting to disagree with them there is always fault with someone’s definition and as a result. People came up with their own definition anyway of what a hypertext is. Marie-LaureRyan[5] stated that in “in hypertext, the reader determines the unfolding of the text clicking on hyperlinks that bring to the screen other segments of a text”. Espen Aarseth[1] argued that hypertext is merely a direct link from one position in a text to another;  well known known researchers argued against this definition because they believed that link-based understandings missed “the profound aspects of hypertext” especially “hypertext-as-interaction with information to build associations, and through associations build knowledge”. </p>

              <p >This week we will be looking at what UX and UI design is, the importance of having good UX and UI design as a designer. Let us first start by defining what UX design and UI design are.</p>  
              <h2> WHAT IS UX DESIGN? <h2>

                <p >User Experience design is a process of design that is centred around the psychology of the end-user, the end-user is the person who would be interacting with your site or game or whatever product you design. This process looks at how the end-user behaves, how they think and their capabilities, and couples it with data collection, an interactive design process, and testing(playtesting, in the context of games). The reason why it is important for designers to use this process is not only for them to just understand the user but it is to also make sure that they create products that will be easy to use, products that will assist users to accomplish certain goals and create meaningful experiences for the users.<p>

                <h2 > WHAT IS UI DESIGN? <h2>

                    <p > Before we look at what UI design is, let us first define the word “Interface”. Interface, according to the Cambridge Dictionary is a “a situation, way, or place where two things come together and affect each other. An interface means that there needs to be some physical interaction between “things”; the interaction can be between a human and a machine, but it is not only limited to humans interacting with machines, it can be between a human and a book etc.
                    User interface design, according to Wikipedia is a space where interactions between humans and machines occur, it also is the manner through which the user interacts with a website for example. It is the design of user interfaces for machines and software, with the focus on maximizing usability and the user experience. User interface design come after user experience design. <p>

           <section>
            <h2 > WHAT IS USABILITY?<h2>

                <p > Usability implies that users can easily use a product and reach their goals faster and without a problem; it is part of the broader term “user experience”. A design is not usable or unusable per se; it’s features along with what the user wants to do with it and the user’s environment, determine its level of usability. </p>
                <p> User experience is often used interchangeably with terms such as user interface design and usability, user interface design and usability are important aspects of user experience design. A user experience designer is concerned with the entire process of acquiring and integrating a product, including the aspects of branding, usability and function. Some of the things investigated by the user experience designers include, whether or not the user understands how to use the product, whether or not they should add more or less features to their design, and can users do what they want to do with the product. A product can have good usability and still have bad user experience, however, a product cannot have usability and still have good user experience. </p>
                <p > If the user cannot use the product for any reason, many times that means that the product does not have inclusiveness or accessibility. Accessibility is the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. It is about creating products that are usable by people with the widest range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations; and making sure that your product is not excluding any group of people.</p>
                <p> User experience designers have to consider all of these factors when creating their products. </p>

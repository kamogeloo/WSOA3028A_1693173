    <p> Artificial intelligence is defined as the science and engineering of creating intelligent machines, this is inclusive of intelligent computer programs. It was described in the 1950s by Minsky and McCarthy as any task performed by a program or a machine that, if a human carried out the same activity, we would say that the human had to apply intelligence to accomplish the task. So, I think that it is safe to say that AI systems behave with a kind of human intelligence, they plan, learn, reason, solve problems, they have knowledge of representation, they have social intelligence and they can also be creative.</p>
    
    <p> AI today has many uses; this includes transferring call data ad email data into record systems, updating records, recommending what a buyer should buy next online on sites, personalizing advertising etc. Applications of AI in use today include Siri, Alexa, Amazon.com, Netflix, Pandora, game playing etc.</p>

    <p> There are different types of branches of AI, for examples, there is logical AI. Logical AI is what an AI system knows about the world in general, how it must act, and its goals, all of these are represented by sentences of mathematical logical language or code rather. There is search AI, this system examines a large number of possibilities. Pattern recognition is an AI system that is programmed to compare recognise and compare what it sees using patterns; other systems include, representation, ontology, heuristics and genetic programming.</p>
    
    <p> Now, racial and gender biases in the AI systems have been found, these biases show deep and hidden imbalances in institutional and social power relations. Joy Buolamwini, the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League, used a facial recognition software and found that the software could not detect her face, it could only do so if she wore a white mask. In a talk that she gave on Wired live, Buolamwini mentioned how the facial recognition software also identified women like Serena Williams, and Michelle Obama and Oprah as males. In her research, she uncovered that indeed there is bias in AI services from companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon.</p>
    
    <p> Gender and racial bias according to James Zou and Londa Schiebinger can be caused by skewed data, they believe that a major driver of bias is the training data, the datasets used for training are said to be biased, narrow and low-quality; and also logically imperfect ML algorithms. But can the AI be biased? Yes, there is some bias in all these systems, but I believe that the bias that we see in all of these systems is of the people programming these systems. It is also because of the fact that there is not enough diversity in the teams that build these systems, as so there is no diversity in the ideas shared in the teams, because they probably share the same interests. </p>
    <p>Software companies need to be more inclusive and introduce diversity so that they can have more diverse ideas and more representation in their systems. More diversity and more inclusion means that the systems will be accessible to everyone.</p>

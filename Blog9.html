    <p>The Internet has become a world of its own, and most people live on the internet, that is where they get their information and for some, that is where they make money. We have always seen or heard about hegemony in terms of media texts, but have you ever thought about it in the context of the internet? I had not until now. </p>
    
    <p> The concept of hegemony as defined by Encyclopedia refers to the dominance of a shared set of ideas, values, and ethics within a society or community during a particular historical period (Encyclopaedia, 2008). It is the social, cultural, ideological, or economic influence that is exerted by a dominant group. Hegemony has to do with power, and in a hegemonic society, the ideas that get to be represented, spread and normalised are those of the bourgeoisie or the dominant group. </p>

    <p>The non-dominant groups (poor countries) do reinforce the hegemony, by supporting the content from the hegemonic group more than their own, and by creating content that follows the rules of producing content that fit in the hegemonic “theme”. But also, the non-dominant group is not to blame for this because they are mostly exposed to and depend on the hegemonic content, while people from rich countries are exposed to their own local content.</p>
    
    <p>If you as a South African go onto your Instagram explorer page right now and look at the people that are dominating that page, most of them will most probably not be South Africans. And if you switch on your television right now you will probably find an American produced movie playing.</p>
    
    <p>Taking power from the hegemon is not something that can be easily done, because their ideas and beliefs have become a way of life, they are a norm and they have become part of our culture.  </p>
